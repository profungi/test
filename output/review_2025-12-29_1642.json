Consequently, we are keeping these ticket prices as low as possible. We have partnered with Charmaine's to give everyone the BEST party at the BEST possible price. Space is limited!Things to rememeber: The Elevator to the roof can only go so fast and carry so many. It's important to stagger the arrivals. Here's how it works:Three Tiers of TicketsEarly Bird Discount $20.26 <> MUST ARRIVE BEFORE 10:00pmEarly Bird General $30.00 <> MUST ARRIVE BEFORE 10:30pmVip/Priority $40.00 <> ENCOURAGED TO ARRIVE AFTER 10:30pm*Note: Those who purchase VIP/Priority will be given priorty to the elevator not matter when they arrive. We might have tickets at the door depending on capacity but we are NOT going to pack the place so folks can't move around and ewnjoy themselves. SPACE IS TRULY LIMITEDWHAT IF IT RAINS?! Well, if it rains, we're still going to do what we can to have a good time and celebrate the arrival of the New Year. This is happening RAIN OR SHINE. However, if it rains, the firepits will be covered and we'll be dancing under tents.DRESS ACCORDINGLY.
