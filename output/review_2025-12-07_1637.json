This year, the 15th annual Fiesta Navideña lights up the night on Saturday, December 13. The celebration features a free concert by Carlos y Charlos, whose passionate norteño and conjunto sounds will resonate through the Mayfair neighborhood for La Plaza’s final event of the year.As the evening falls, families gather to enjoy festive activities for all ages, including an enchanting folklórico performance by longtime partners Los Lupeños de San José. Guests can participate in an interactive posada, celebrating a cherished Mexican tradition of hospitality while welcoming the holiday season, presented by Teatro Vision. The night will also feature an art workshop for all ages, local vendors offering handmade crafts and gifts, and the delicious aroma of steaming tamales.“For many people from the local community, the Mexican Heritage Plaza serves as a second home, a place where they can celebrate traditions from Mexico and across Latin America. For years, Fiesta Navideña has brought generations together to honor culture, faith, and family. Attendees may have traveled here and left their motherland, but they carry traditions with them, and it’s our duty to be the place where they can come together and celebrate.”Read moreCategory: Holiday, Christmas",

Meet your guide near Chinatown in the Jackson Square Historic District -- a little-known Gold Rush-era neighborhood with eerie, well-preserved Victorian architecture.Your tour guide will outfit everyone with an EMF meter that you'll use throughout the paranormal investigation, and explain the types of hauntings and ghosts that we encounter in San Francisco.From there we'll enter the old neighborhood, hearing about the forgotten graves and ships buried beneath us.Down quiet alleyways, we'll learn of the destruction of the Great Earthquake of 1906, and the residual hauntings that still plague the neighborhood.At any point, we might detect EMF activity, and we'll investigate further using tools such as dowsing rods and a Spirit Box.In Chinatown, we'll learn of the tragedies that mark the neighborhood's past, including the true crimes whose energies still linger, from a mysterious death in a historic theatre, to the city's biggest massacre at the Golden Dragon.We'll end the investigation with a ceremony to honor whatever spirits joined us, with a ritual to ensure that nothing follows you home.Read moreCategory: Holiday, Halloween",
