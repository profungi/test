      "description_detail": "Join us to uncover the secrets behind successful colleg admissions with the ultimate “Spike” strategy!Why You Can’t Miss This EventThe admissions logic for top schools has completely changed. Top schools are no longer looking for students who “do a little bit of everything.” They now want students with a clear, sharp, and distinctive Spike—a single area of excellence. Admissions officers are no longer searching for “well-rounded students,” but for standout individuals who complete a diverse class like puzzle pieces.What You Will GainDuring this session, you’ll get a complete framework to help your child develop their Spike:✔ Real Case Analysis: How top students leverage one strong area to stand out.✔ G8–G12 Identity Building: How to combine academics + extracurriculars effectively.✔ The Biggest Pitfall: Why “joining everything casually” can derail your child.✔ Counseling Planning Roadmap: Annual strategy from G8 Exploration → G9 Focus → G10 Formation → G11 BreakthroughSpecial HostJun LiuAs the founder and CEO of 7EDU, she brings over 20 years of expertise in K–12 education and college counseling. She has guided thousands of students in building standout academic and extracurricular profiles, with 95% gaining admission to Top 30 U.S. universities and over 300 students accepted to Ivy League and other top-tier institutions. Her results-driven approach has consistently empowered students to reach—and often exceed—their highest potential.Get Your Questions Answered – Personalized AdviceThis onsite coffee hour is interactive! Parents will have the opportunity to ask questions directly during the session.💡 Pro Tip: To make the most of this personalized guidance, you can submit your specific questions during registration. Ms. Jun will answer your questions during coffee hour to address your child’s unique situation.Whether it’s about selecting the right extracurriculars, refining your child’s Spike, or planning a multi-year strategy, this is your chance to get tailored insights that you won’t find in generic guides.🗓 Date & Time: Saturday, December 13, 2025 | 10:30 AM – 12:00 PM☕ Language: Mandarin ONLY📍 Location: 10050 Bubb Rd Suite 2, Cupertino CA🍵 Perks: Coffee, tea, and light snacks providedRead moreCategory: Family & Education, Education",
